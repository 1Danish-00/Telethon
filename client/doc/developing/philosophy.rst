Philosophy
==========

* Dependencies should only be added when absolutely necessary.
* Dependencies written in anything other than Python cannot be mandatory.
* The library must work correctly with no system dependencies other than Python 3.
* Strict type-checking is required to pass everywhere in the library to make upgrades easier.
* The code structure must make use of hard and clear boundaries to keep the different parts decoupled.
* The API should cover only the most commonly used features to avoid bloat and reduce maintenance costs.
* Documentation must be a pleasure to use and contain plenty of code examples.
