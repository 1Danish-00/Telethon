Coding style
============

Knowledge of Python is a obviously a must to develop a Python library.
A good online resource is `Dive Into Python 3 <http://www.diveintopython3.net/>`_.

Telethon uses multiple tools to automatically format the code and check for linting rules.
This means you can simply ignore formatting and let the tools handle it for you.
You can find these tools under the ``tools/`` folder.

The documentation is written with mostly a newline after every period.
This is not a hard rule.
Lines can be cut earlier if they become too long to be comfortable.

Commit messages should be short and descriptive.
They should start with an action in the present ("Fix" and not "Fixed").
This saves a few characters and represents what the commit will "do" after applied.
